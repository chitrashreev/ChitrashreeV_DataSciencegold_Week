Conclusion

In this assignment, a Linear Regression model was successfully implemented to predict commodity prices using historical gold price data. The dataset was prepared and processed correctly, and the model was trained using key features such as Open, High, and Low prices to predict the Close price.

The results show that Linear Regression can effectively capture the relationship between input features and commodity prices for a small dataset. The model evaluation metrics indicate satisfactory performance, and the visualization confirms that the predicted values are close to the actual prices.

This project demonstrates the basic steps involved in solving a regression problem using machine learning and provides a foundation for further improvement by using larger datasets or more advanced models.
