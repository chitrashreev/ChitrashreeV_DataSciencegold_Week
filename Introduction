Introduction

Commodity price prediction plays an important role in financial analysis and economic decision-making.
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict commodity prices using historical data.

In this assignment, a small Gold Price dataset is used, containing features such as Open, High, and Low prices, with Close price as the target variable. The dataset is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and a Linear Regression model is trained to learn the relationship between the features and the target price.

This project demonstrates the basic workflow of a machine learning regression problem, including data preparation, model training, prediction, and evaluation, using Python and popular data science libraries.
